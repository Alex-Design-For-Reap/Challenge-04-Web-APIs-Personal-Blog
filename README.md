# Challenge-04-Web-APIs-Personal-Blog

This repo will be used for submitting and deploying my application for week 4 - Web-APIs-Personal-Blog

# Challenge-03-JavaScript

This repo will be used to submit my challenge for week 4 while creating my first personal blog using APIs.
The week's challenge required myself to create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle.

## Description

- The motivation for doing this project is to get to know with APIs, gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## Learnings

While working on this project I had the chance to work on things I've been learning from week 1, plus adding new knowledge to my toll box, such as:

- Leveraging knowledge acquired since week 1 while building HTML pages, stylying it using CSS, and make it dynamic using JavaScript.
- **CSS** new learnings:using `[data-theme="]{}` to have different theme mode (dark/light) and use same attributes to classes and ids, making it more manageable and scalable.
- Store data to localStorage.
- Using `JSON.stringify` to convert objects to be added to localStorage and `JSON.parse` to convert it back to objects to be used by JavaScript.
- Using `.getElementById` to apply JS methods on it.
- Using `addEventListener` to trigger JS methods/functions.
- `seItem` to define key and values for objects added to localStorage.
- Creating a blog card with `createElement`and `appendChild`, and applying style to it using classes and ids, making it dinamic based on user interaction.
- learning how to use the `.forEach()` method to iterate over each element of the array and perform a specified action on each element.
